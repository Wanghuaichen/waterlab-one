# Waterlab One
## Smart water purification by a UCSC senior design team.

We are attempting to make a smart-system capable of filtering post-flocculation
secondary treated wastewater and make it potable. This will require lots of power conditioning and some intelligent use of filtration
stages, this is that intelligence. 

Programmed for the PSOC 5LP (for now).
